        Substring Matching Design:
              I used the LIKE operator to match strings and substrings, so that
              the query can match the pattern that the users enter in the input box.
			
              I converted the attributes to lowercase so that the comparison can be
              performed case insensitively. This makes it easier on the user, so that
              they don't have to provide the exact string to be matched, including
              the case.
